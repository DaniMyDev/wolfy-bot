## Usage
To use wolfy sucessfully in your channel:
math expression examples: 2+2, 2^3, x^3+2, sin(x)/cos(x)
equal sized arrays: [1,2,3,4] [2,4,9,16] (this will print square x!)
sympy equations: 2+x**3+sin(x) (beware to use x as variable)

```bash
   !wolfy <wolfram math expression>
   !wolfyplot <2 arrays of equal size>
   !wolfyplotf <sympy.sympify expressions>
```
